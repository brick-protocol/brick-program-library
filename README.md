## Marketplace customization

Marketplace creators have the freedom to customize their platforms based on their specific requirements. 

The following customizable features are available:
  
- **Manage Access**: Marketplaces can opt for a permissionless model, allowing anyone to sell on the platform without the need for verification. Alternatively, a token gate or KYC process can be implemented for controlled access.

- **Rewards or Cashback**: Marketplaces can incentivize users by offering rewards or cashback for their purchases on the platform, enhancing user engagement and loyalty.

- **Transaction Fees**: The marketplace has the flexibility to set transaction fees for facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. This allows marketplaces to generate revenue from the platform operations.
  
- **Secondary Market Support**: Marketplaces can decide whether products or services can be resold, thereby creating a secondary market for items. When users register a purchase, a token can be minted, granting them access to the specific product or service.
